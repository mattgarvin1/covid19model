# 84017031 -> ID for Cook County

"big sim"

Wednesday, June 3rd

Experiment:
    - covid case and mortality data run through this past Monday, June 1st
    - ran the model for all IL counties with greater than 10 cumulative reported deaths
    - this yielded results for 25 counties
    - ran the stan model with 8000 iterations, 4000 warmup, 8 chains
    - on my laptop, this simulation took ~2.8 hours

Visualizations:
    1. 3-panel and forecast plots for Cook county
    2. final Rt by county plot
    3. the explore plots

Comments:
    - almost all counties have fewer than 100 cumulative reported deaths

    - in particular, about 16 counties have fewer than 50 cumulative reported deaths

    - for these counties with a small number of observations,
    we see corresponding large 90% confidence bands around estimates of final Rt

    - notice that for Cook county (ID 84017031 - i.e., the fourth from the top in the Rt plot)
    we have a very small confidence band - indeed the smallest confidence band,
    because Cook county has the greatest number of observations

    - running the STAN model yielded warnings about lack of convergence.
    These convergence issues are due in large part (perhaps entirely)
    to the small number of observations available for most counties, as explained above.
    As time passes and we obtain more and more observations,
    the simulation will exhibit better and better convergence behavior.

    - even with big confidence bands, the majority of counties have a final Rt of less than 1

    - Cook county has a mean final Rt of slightly bigger than 1,
    though it is very close to 1 and the tight 90% confidence band does extend to slightly below 1.

    - daily reported deaths appear to dip once every seven days.
    this is more than likely an artifact of data collection/reporting over the weekend.
    we could apply a simple smoothing/correction method to see if that improves the fit of the model

    - reduction in Rt is negatively correlated with reported deaths.
    that is, the greater the number of cumulative reported deaths within a county,
    the smaller the reduction in Rt.
    my guess explanation for this is that
    for counties with a small number of observations,
    the model tends to default to a large reduction in Rt
